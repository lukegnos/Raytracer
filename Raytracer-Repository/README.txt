* Luke Gnos

* Project 5

* Spheres, including the one in shadow experiences color bleeding with MC tracing.
* Planes were less cooperative, although you can see a slight increase in brightness on the the green wall behind the spheres.

* I tried several different scenes to show an interesting color bleeding shot, but
  none of them turned out that well, so I went with the 5 spheres.
  
* Runtimes:
   - giSimple.pov: ~85 minutes
   - myScene2.pov: ~35 minutes
